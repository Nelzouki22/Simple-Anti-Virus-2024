Overview
The Antivirus Project is a basic antivirus application developed in C++ that monitors a specified directory for file changes, including creation, modification, and deletion. This project aims to provide a foundational understanding of how antivirus software operates by tracking file changes in real time and alerting users to potential threats or unauthorized modifications.

Features
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuously monitors a specified directory for changes in files.
Change Detection: Identifies newly created, modified, and deleted files, providing timely alerts to users.
File Metadata Display: Displays the last modification time and the total number of changes for each monitored file.
Console Output: Utilizes colored text in the console to differentiate between new files, modified files, and deleted files for improved visibility.
Future Enhancements
To make the Antivirus Project more robust and effective, the following features are planned for future implementation:

File Scanning for Known Malicious Signatures: Incorporating a feature that scans files for known malicious signatures to enhance detection capabilities.
Suspicious Application Behavior Detection: Developing the ability to detect and stop suspicious application behavior, adding an extra layer of security.
Complex Malware Detection Algorithms: Implementing more advanced algorithms for detecting various types of malware, making the application more efficient in identifying potential threats.
Technical Details
Programming Language: C++
Libraries Used:
filesystem: For file system operations and monitoring.
chrono: For handling time-related functions and real-time monitoring.
thread: To implement delays between checks, optimizing resource usage.
iomanip and sstream: For formatting output and displaying timestamps.
